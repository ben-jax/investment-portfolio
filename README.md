# investment-portfolio
An investment portfolio made with python and visualized using streamlit. In this project, I used python to model a portfolio, where users can buy and sell positions, check market value and cost for entire portfolio and each position in portfolio. 

This project was visualized using streamlit, which was used to make a python web app for the portfolio. In this project I furthered my knowledge in python and using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and yfinance. I also gained experience working with miniconda and git bash for making virtual environments during my development process. Finally I added to my expertise in GitHub, utilizing its version control and in Visual Studio Code as my main python development IDE. 

New skills learned from this project are specifically the streamlit library and more broadly using python to make web apps and interactive data visualization.

# Files
- **[main.py: ]()** Main program file houses the stock class for individual stock valuation as well as the portfolio class for portfolio operations and manipulations.
- **[app.py: ]()** Streamlit file for running streamlit page. All design and formating for streamlit page is done on this file, as well as visualization of data. Matplotlib is used in this file calculating charts seen on streamlit.

# Technologies Used
python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, streamlit, yfinance, git bash, miniconda, visual studio code, github
